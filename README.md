As fickle cosmic powers are they choose to collided to create the 4 gods of  known as GHAR 
the gods of ghar each with a different ability ,
g had the gift of knowledge,
h had the gift of energy, 
a had the gift of  creation , 
h had the supreme gift of destruction. 

The gods of knowledge and creation wanted peace in the universe. They had an enormous affection for the 
humans of Earth who had no knowledge of the existence of the gods. The gods of energy and destruction

the fate of mankind.
